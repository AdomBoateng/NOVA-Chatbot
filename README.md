 *   **Tokenization**: This  is splitting a string into meaning units.


 *   **Stemming**: a natural language processing technique that lowers inflection in words to their root forms, 
hence aiding in the preprocessing of text, words, and documents for text normalization.


 *   **Bag of Words**: a natural language processing (NLP) strategy for converting a text document into numbers that can be used by a computer program. 
BoW is often implemented as a Python dictionary.

**Sentence**: Are you eating or sleeping?
- Tokenize: `["Are", "you", "eating", "or", "sleeping", "?"]`
- Lower + stem: `["are", "you", "eat", "or", "sleep", "?"]`
- Exclude punctuations: `["are", "you", "eat", "or", "sleep"]`
- Bag of words: `X â€“ features: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
